Accenture Development Coding Round Topics &
Hands-On Task List
Use this checklist to prepare for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript full-stack style tasks. If you can

specificity, basic media queries
• JavaScript Core: let/const, loops, conditions, functions, type conversion, arrays
• Array Methods: map, filter, reduce
• DOM Manipulation: getElementById, querySelector, innerText, innerHTML, value, style
changes, classList
• Events: click, input, change, submit, addEventListener, preventDefault
• Timing: setInterval, clearInterval, setTimeout
